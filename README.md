# reorder_binary_matrix

Unlike with R, not as much work with python on reorganising data matrices to better visualise mutation data. 
This code takes a matrix with containing binary expression data, and reorganises the rows and columns to facilitate visual comparability (typically would then visualise with heatmaps etc.)
